I'm Kaoffie, also known as Kathy; I'm currently studying Computer Science in University. I'm interested in anything related to text entry, including stenography and IMEs; I'm also passionate about languages and linguistics, especially East Asian languages and CJKV characters. I make Discord bots in my free time, including [Yulin](https://kaoffie.github.io/yulin-site/), a Chinese Dictionary bot. You can contact me through [Email](mailto:kaoffie@gmail.com) or through my Discord at `Kaoffie@9001`!
